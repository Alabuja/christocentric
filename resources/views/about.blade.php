	    	<p>Christocentric Lyrics is committed to educating the world through songs we provide on our platform majorly about what Christ has done, consecration, thanksgiving etc. We are dedicated to providing easy access to solely Christocentric Songs that are in-line with the <strong>NEW CREATION REALITIES</strong> because there is not a lot platform out there that support that. With that in mind, we have decided to fill in the gap by providing easy access to Christ Centered Songs to Christians all over the World who find it hard to recognize songs that are in-line with their new nature in Christ Jesus. We understand from 1Timothy 2:4 (Amplified Version -- <strong>Who wishes all men to be saved and [increasingly] to perceive and recognize and discern and know precisely and correctly the [divine] Truth.</strong>) that after salvation, the need to grow in knowledge is needed for every believer. We believe a major way people can grow in their knowledge of Christ is through music by acknowledging who they’re in Christ Jesus. As E.W Kenyon said, <strong>“Our greatest difficulty has been that we forget what we are in Christ. We remember what we have been. We remember what we were in the old life. We remember our failures, our weaknesses, and our lack, but we forget that the New Creation is the end of failure because God has imparted Himself to us. ”</strong>, we agree with him but we desire to help the New Creation remember always who he is by providing him with songs to do that and therefore live a Victorious Christ Life.</p>

	    	<p>The songs on our platform when submitted by music lovers are reviewed by the administrators to check if they are in line with the New Creation Realities before they are accepted as part of Songs on our platform. </p>

	    	<strong>Vision</strong>
	    	<p>To birth and strengthen Convictions about Christ and to help Christians live a victorious Christian life.</p>

	    	<strong>Mission</strong>
	    	<p>To cover the earth with the knowledge of God <br/><br/> 
	    		Habakkuk 2:14 “For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.”
	    	</p>

	    	<p><strong>We call you blessed, and hope you find our site useful for your growth in Christ. <br/><br/>Cheers!!!</strong></p>
